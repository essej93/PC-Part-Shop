### PC Part Shop
## Description
This is a program i made in my first year (i had no idea how to structure code at this point) which uses the Java Swing package to create an interface for a shop to order PC parts.

It loads the parts within the program and creates persistent data when the program is closed and reloaded using the serialization implementation. This creates a .ser file which is loaded on each other use. 

# Compile/Execution
cd to the directory
run "javac CSFrame.java"
then "java CSFrame"
